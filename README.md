### `Motivation`<br>
Ben, Stella, and Zack met at the Recurse Center. Ben is backend focused with an expertise in algorithms. Stella and Zack are frontend focused with backgrounds in atmospheric research/teaching and art/writing, respectively.<br><br>

Stella was curious to ascertain a framework to acquire a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. She noticed the paper flowers she made and hung behind her desk resembled linked lists. Were the flower petals nodes of a circularly linked list?<br><br>

Ben, Stella, and Zack decided to collaborate on a project: reimagining data structures and algorithms through the natural world - a universal language.
