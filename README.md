### `Motivation`<br>
Ben, Stella, and Zack met at the Recurse Center. Ben was a data structures and algorithms expert. Stella and Zack were largely project-based, with backgrounds in atmospheric dynamics/teaching and art/writing, respectively.<br><br>

Stella was curious to ascertain a framework to acquire a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. She noticed the paper flowers she made hanging behind her desk resembled linked lists. Were the flower petals nodes of a circularly linked list?<br><br>

Ben, Stella, and Zack collaborated on a project: reimagining data structures and algorithms through the natural world - a universal language.
