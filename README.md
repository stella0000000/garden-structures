### `Motivation`<br>
Ben, Stella, and Zack met at the Recurse Center. Ben is backend leaning with a deep appreciation for algorithms, 3D, and mathematics. Stella and Zack are frontend leaning with backgrounds in research/teaching, and art/writing, respectively.<br><br>

Stella was curious to ascertain a framework to acquire a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. She noticed the paper flowers hanging behind her desk resembled linked lists. Were the flower petals nodes of a circularly linked list?<br><br>

The trio decided to collaborate on a project: reimagining data structures and algorithms through the natural world - a universal language. This project is in progress.<br><br>

### `Technologies`<br>
- TypeScript
- React Three Fiber (3D)
- Vite
- Vercel

### `Functionalities`<br>
- Users are invited to garden data structures
- Behold algorithms

### `Future Considerations`<br>
- Backend: database of gardens / user auth
