### `Motivation`<br>
Ben, Stella, and Zack met during Daily Leetcode at the Recurse Center. Ben was a cool and generous algorithm sensei. Stella and Zack were largely project-based, with backgrounds in atmospheric dynamics and art/writing, respectively.<br><br>

After her first algorithm interview, Stella reflected on the experience, and was curious to ascertain a framework to acquire a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. She noticed the paper flowers she made behind her desk resembled doubly linked lists. Were the flower petals nodes of a circularly linked list?<br><br>

Ben, Stella, and Zack collaborated on a project: reimagining data structures through the natural world - a universal language - and exploring algorithms via storytelling. They became software gardeners in an effort to illuminate new perspectives.
