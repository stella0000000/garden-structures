### `Motivation`<br>
Ben, Stella, and Zack met at the Recurse Center. They were curious to ascertain a framework to acquire a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. Stella noticed the paper flowers hanging behind her desk resembled linked lists. Were the flower petals nodes of a circularly linked list?<br><br>

The trio decided to collaborate on a project: reimagining data structures and algorithms through the natural world - a universal language.<br><br>
